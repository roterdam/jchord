To run Jasmin: "java -jar jasmin-r3505.jar <list of .j files>"

Jasmin is compiled from Soot (www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/) svn reposotory (Rev. 3505).

MantisInstrumentor
==================

Instruments each class C with the following:

1. For each ItIntCmp quad in each method of this class (say located at bytecode
   index XXX in method with index YYY in domain M), add static fields
   C.bXXXmYYY_bef and C.bXXXmYYY_aft of type iny to the class and increment them
   immediately before and immediately after that quad.

   The following conditional branch bytecode instructions are covered by the
   IfIntCmp quad:
   - if_acmpeq, if_acmpne
   - if_icmpeq, if_icmpne, if_icmplt, if_icmpgt, if_icmple, if_icmpge
   - ifeq, iflt, ifle, ifne, ifgt, ifge
   - ifnull, ifnonnull

   The only ones not considered are tableswitch and lookupswitch.  Support for
   these will be added later.

2. For each MethodCall expression in each method of this class (say located at
   bytecode index XXX in method with index YYY in domain M) which returns a
   result of primitive type:
   - bool: add static fields C.bXXXmYYY_true and C.bXXXmYYY_false of type int
     to this class and increment them depending on whether the result is true
     or false, respectively.
   - byte/short/int/long: add static fields C.bXXXmYYY_long_sum and 
     C.bXXXmYYY_long_freq of type long and int, respectively, to this class and
     add the result value to the sum field and increment the freq field.
   - float/double: add static fields C.bXXXmYYY_double_sum and
     C.bXXXmYYY_double_freq of type double and int, respectively, to this class
     and add the result value to the sum field and increment the freq field.

TODO: Perhaps it is not necessary to instrument method calls which return a
result of type boolean, since some branch being instrumented will be conditioned
on it.
