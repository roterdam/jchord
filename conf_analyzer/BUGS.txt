This file holds a (hopefully) current list of known bugs, limitations, and imprecisions.

1) We don't track string constants through fields. This limits completeness of results in finding conf options.

2) We don't really handle Map.get/put correctly.

3) Option name inference is wrong if there are multiple pieces for multiple option names at same call
