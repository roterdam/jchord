// FIXED BUGS:
//  off-by-one error jq_Atom
//  alg error constantpool forward refs
//  cut & paste error, used old idx rather than new one

//  when initializing type descriptors, byte to string converts to int, not char
//  cut & paste error, forgot to change memcmp in utf8.get
//  forgot a "break" in big bytecode traverser switch statement
//  off-by-one error, index should start at -1 in bytecode traverser
//  parsed array descriptors in constant pool as class descriptors
//  forgot to set constant_pool_tag to resolved when field is known at load time
//  forgot to set resolved flag in InstanceField.resolve()

//  added default types to Trimmer without preparing them
//  forgot to recompile Trimmer after change
//  assumed entrySet() returned set of objects rather than Map.Entry objects
//  forgot to change result of Class.getName() from '.' delimiters to '/' delimiters
//  in compiler, direct-bind invokes didn't check if the target method was compiled yet
//  interleaving trimming and compiling was wrong.  we need to trim all classes, then compile.
//  in trim, forgot to reset field and method offsets to INVALID_OFFSET
//  in trim, forgot to reset overrides flag for virtual methods
//  accidentally reversed isConstant test in jq_StaticField
//  off-by-one error in check to grow array in x86CodeBuffer
//  cut-and-paste error: forgot to update assertion about instruction length in x86

//  in trimmer, forgot to load classes for getfield/putfield ops
//  in trimmer, forgot to add root method to necessary member set
//  in bootstrapper, java/lang/Object static fields were allocated first
//  in bootstrapper, forgot to initialize static fields
//  in trimmer, forgot to add current static field values as instantiated types
//  in trimmer, not only current static field values, but everything reachable from them are instantiated
//  debugmsg takes byte array, not char array.
//  cut-and-paste error; writing to object arrays shifted by 3 instead of 2
//  forgot to initialize vtable after compiling instance methods
//  compared to 0 instead of INVALID_OFFSET in InstanceMethod.isVirtual
//  native routines should be marked __stdcall
//  in assembler, forgot to change endianness of 16 bit constants
//  vtable entries for inherited methods were not getting initialized
//  when backpatching forward branches, the pointer points after the site to be branched, rather than before
//  +/- error when calculating backward branch offsets
//  when calling Unsafe methods, codegen was assuming it needed to push the return values
//  reversed the order of the arguments in compilation of Unsafe.poke
//  SHIFT_ONCE value was incorrect
//  field offsets were all off by OBJ_HEADER_SIZE
//  conditional near backward jumps were off by 1 byte (instruction length 6, not 5)
//  put assertion in the wrong place in UTF8.isBootstrapJavaLang
//  forgot to update jq_ClassLoader.getType when adding classlib bootstrap support
//  UTF8.isBootstrapJavaLang test was not robust enough
//  forgot to add hijack code when using reflection in Trimmer and Bootstrapper
//  forgot to add fallback to hijack code when using reflection

//  order of ops with << in invokeinterface
//  in checkcast/instance_of, reversed arguments of call to isAssignable
//  off-by-one error: forgot that invokeinterface runtime routine took an extra argument
//  trimmed interface types by checking against instantiated types, which is wrong
//  base object was wrong when calling getVirtualMethod when looking up interface methods in Trimmer
//  calculated address of arguments, but forgot to do a "peek" in invokeinterface
//  forgot to return value from invokeinterface
//  fixed typo in Unsafe.getThreadBlock read from FS[14]
//  cut-and-paste error: method exits were guarded by TraceBytecodes instead of TraceMethods
//  arguments pushed to call to arraystorecheck were incorrect
//  forgot to add System.in/out/err as necessary members
//  need to map java.lang.Class objects to jav_.lang.Class objects during bootstrapping, because they don't have field jq_type
//  likewise, need to map java.lang.ClassLoader objects to jav_.lang.ClassLoader
//  sun.io.CharToSingleByteConverter was being created with reflection and therefore Trimmer didn't catch it
//  forgot to change jq_Initializer and jq_ClassInitializer when adding VOID as a type
//  when jikes compiles static class references, it puts an "L" at the start of the name, so it wasn't finding the field with reflection.
//  skipped transient primitive fields caused a null pointer exception when writing their values
//  forgot to subtract from startAddress in some of the poke() methods in BootImage
//  calls to Unsafe were not successfully being bypassed in Trimmer (break; -> return;)
//  forgot to add fields/methods from Unsafe as necessary, leading them to being trimmed and a crash in bytecode traversal
//  code to trim references in constant pool replaced references with "jq_NameAndDesc" rather than "jq_MemberReference"
//  accidentally added Unsafe.<clinit> to the necessary method list in Trimmer
//  compiled_methods should not be a null static field
//  0xc001d00d was not causing a hardware trap when dereferenced!
//  stupid typo in debugmsg(String), was calling itself rather than debugmsg(byte[])
//  forgot to initialize jq_Type.class_object field during bootstrap
//  in ObjectTraverser, forgot to add support for arrays/primitive types when mapping between jq_Type and Class objects
//  primitive types use Integer.TYPE, not Integer.class
//  __stdcall has arguments in reverse order on stack! changed SystemInterface to match.
//  we can't actually skip transient fields (ArrayList.elementData is transient)
//  can't use Integer to represent code locations, as Integer.compareTo throws a ClassCastException
//  reversed the cases in jq_CompiledCode.compareTo, so it was never finding anything.
//  problem when Object or x86ReferenceLinker contains a native or abstract method, because during compilation it recursively tries to initialize itself.
//  adding compiled code when using bogus remapper crashes because the addresses are the same.  disabled compilation during bogus remapping.
//  confused order of reflective interpreter stack -> grows up, sp points to empty space
//  accidently shifted getParamWords left by 2, causing the interpreter to crash
//  forgot to check for null exception type in exception handling (from finally regions)
//  forgot to add a 'return' when calling object initializer during interpretation, leading to stack underflow
//  forgot to set thisptr param when calling getfield in reflective interpreter
//  problem with trying to interpret abstract method. added assertions so that it will be easier to catch next time.
//  forgot to roll back to previous state in interpreter when a method doesn't catch an exception
//  variable assignment bug in reflective interpreter invokehelper, assigned to m rather than f
//  can't call Thread.interrupt0 reflectively, so we skip over it in the reflective interpreter.
//  the reflective interpreter was crashing on checkcast/instanceof of null
//  correction to above- interpreter wasn't calling ANY private methods correctly. changed to use "getDeclaredMethod" rather than "getMethod"
//  forgot to add fields to ObjectTraverser after adding them to JDK classes
//  i2l is broken, it reversed the hi and lo words
//  lcmp/fcmp/dcmp were broken, the branch was off by one so less than returned equals
//  long shifts were incorrect, invalid instruction for AND_r_i8
//  bug in transcribing uqdivrem function: misread "1" as "i"
//  bug in x86CodeBuffer: when generated method overflowed the buffer, it initialized the counter to 0 rather than -1.  Manifested as incorrect backpatching.
//  frem/drem were incorrect because loads pushed the values on the stack, so they got reversed.
//  left a value on the fp register stack when doing fcmp/dcmp/frem/drem, which eventually caused later FP operations to mysteriously return NaN
//  in Trimmer, forgot to load/verify/prepare array classes from subarrays created with multinewarray
//  cut-and-paste error: BytecodeVisitor for LASTORE actually called visitIASTORE
//  arrayStoreCheck did not check for null before doing a getTypeOf on the object
//  getJavaLangObject() didn't work, probably because of some incorrect field masking behavior. renamed it to prim_desc2type.
//  forgot to add a base case to recursion in multinewarray_helper
//  in compiler, forgot to pop args after call to multinewarray runtime function
//  in multinewarray, looking up of varargs didn't take into account the two arguments already there
//  in multinewarray, args were used in reverse order
//  calculating the branch target in tableswitch was off by 4
//  f2i/f2l/d2i/d2l were rounding the incorrect way for negative values
//  used the wrong offset when loading back fp control word
//  used wrong mask for rounding mode in fp control word (0x0c00 not 0x60)
//  f2i/f2l/d2i/d2l did not handle exceptional cases (too big, too small, NaN) so I added explicit checks
//  forgot to free floating point registers in f2i/f2l/d2i/d2l exceptional cases
//  checking for catch blocks checked absolute ip's rather than offsets from code start, causing exceptions not to work
//  long-standing bug in Trimmer, addSuperclassVirtualMethods didn't work at all because the loop condition was reversed (c==null vs. c!=null)
//  bug in exception deliverer, order of operations: x<<2+4 is x<<(2+4) not (x<<2)+4
//  can't use JMath as replacement for StrictMath because it messes up bootstrapping, so moved to a separate class and made them call it
//  after bootstrapping, Class objects referred to the old system classloader.  fixed objecttraverser to map old classloader to the new one.
//  primordial classloader parent field referred to itself, leading to infinite recursion.
//  findBootstrapClass added L...; to the class name twice.
//  trycatch exception types were never actually being set (parameter name was "extype" rather than "exType")
//  did a +4 rather than a -4 when setting the exception object when branching to a catch block
//  looking up methods by ip didn't work if the ip pointed to the end address.  changed >= to >.
//  file open/close were not passing the file names as null-terminated byte strings
//  bug in exception handler range check, the given offset refers to the instr after the one that threw the exception, so it should check (low,high], not [low,high)
//  in reflective interpreter stack, popping longs was incorrect (did ++ instead of --)
//  in interpreter, lcmp2 pushes int, not long
//  in interpreter, lshift had the order of the two arguments reversed
//  cut-and-paste error: in BytecodeVisitor, dstore was actually calling visitLSTORE
//  forgot to load/verify/prepare exception types before doing type checks on them
//  bug in synchronized hack in reflective interpreter: synchronized methods executed twice because monitorenter also executes them
//  in reflective interpreter, exiting from a synchronized method didn't revert the state back to the old one.
//  passing double parameters in reflective interpreter was broken, because it pushed the double value of the long bits, rather than the real double value.
//  typo: interpreter was comparing FCMP2/DCMP2 arguments to "CMP_LT" rather than "CMP_L", leading it to always do the "CMP_G" case
//  forgot to redirect Unsafe.getTypeOf in reflective interpreter
//  forgot to redirect getJavaLangClassObject in reflective interpreter
//  scratch the last one, getfield/getstatic now all go through the ObjectTraverser
//  in FileInputStream.readBytes (and FileOutputStream.writeBytes), bounds check was off-by-one (off+len-1, not off+len)
//  FileInputStream.read was returning the return code from the read() call, rather than the actual byte read
//  files were being opened in text mode (default), causing reading to stop at the first ^Z character
//  when a class is dynamically loaded, it may refer to methods/fields that were trimmed. oops!
//  typo: field in ClassLoader was named _jq_type, rather than _desc2type
//  typo: poke1 signature was (II)V, instead of (IB)V
//  passed wrong flag into Trimmer (!TrimAllTypes == AddAllClassMembers)
//  forgot to load/verify/prepare classes of methods added to the worklist in Trimmer
//  forgot to redirect fields of java.util.zip.ZipFile after redirecting the class to org.jos.
//  using reflection on java.lang.ref.Finalizer objects is bad.  they change behind our backs.
//  jq_StaticMethod/jq_StaticField.needsDynamicLink was incorrect.  it should have been calling jq_Class.needsDynamicLink.
//  some of the patch_ routines in x86ReferenceCompiler were patching with poke4 rather than poke2
//  forgot to add "L" and ";" to class name of main class to load.
//  had the wrong descriptor when searching for main method (forgot '[')
//  reversed the order of code offset, bc index when building jq_BytecodeMap in reference compiler
//  typo in linker: loaded class "_class" rather than class "k"
//  when heap overflows, forgot to add object size to heapCurrent after allocating new block.  caused seemingly random but completely repeatable crashes.
//  patching invokestatic calls patched the absolute target address, not the relative offset to the target address.
//  LineNumberTable is an attribute of Code, not of MethodInfo
//  forgot to set jq_LineNumberBC as Comparable
//  incorrectly assumed that instance methods never needed dynamic links (if the target method is not compiled, it is necessary)
//  patch_invokevirtual instructions were incorrect
//  backpatching assumed retloc was at the end of the backpatch region
//  forgot to update return values from patch routines to reflect that retloc was not at the end of the backpatch region
//  in reference compiler, can't assert that a method is an interface until the class is loaded.
//  forgot to load/verify/prepare subarray types in isAssignable
//  forgot to cls_initialize when doing newarray
//  accidently was passing "args" to main, instead of "main_args", so the args included the main class name
//  when running under win2000, calloc would return memory with a lower address than the boot image memory, messing up exception delivery
//  forgot that cls_init could recursively call itself if a superclass created an object of a subclass's type in its clinit
//  during startup, primitive descriptors may not yet be registered in desc2type, so we need to set primitive-typed field descriptors after registering the primitive types.
//  incorrectly assumed that AllocEnabled in BootImage implied that Class objects would be allocated when doing state changes.
//  accidentally used abs rather than EA when emitting code for cas4
//  bug in putfield4 backpatch: was doing 8 bit version of instruction
//  typo: when growing array in Win32FileSystem.list, did "s2 = s" rather than "s = s2"
//  forgot to replace '.' with '/' when building descriptor for main class
//  mixed up the from and to arguments in memcpy
//  cut-and-paste bug in assembler: emit2_DISP32_SEImm8 was setting DISP8, rather than DISP32.  manifested in iinc of large indexed local var.
//  wrong flags to _open when opening for writing
//  thought that read() returned 0 at EOF, but it actually returns 1 (because it reroutes through readBytes())
//  during bootstrapping, class initialization triggered Unsafe.getTypeOf() in an assertion before the remapper was installed
//  cycle in dependencies for clinit, leading to null pointer exceptions because fields weren't initialized yet
//  forgot a ; in class descriptor, leading to getStaticField to attempt to check superclasses, leading to load being called recursively.
//  forgot to skip class initializers when merging static methods from one class into another
//  forgot to update mirror ClassLoader static methods to have the jq_Class as the first argument
//  when merging classes, we can't use the state variable from the class anymore, each member needs its own copy.
//  forgot to initialize state variable to STATE_LOADED when creating bridge methods to merged class
//  forgot to update mirror Class static methods to have the jq_Class as the first argument
//  accidentally was making more than one copy of some primitive types, because creating the primitive types triggered jq_Primitive to be clinited, so when we returned they had already been created.
//  accidentally put "java/lang/Map" rather than "java/util/Map" for a field type descriptor
//  jq_Class objects for nonexistent mirror classes were sticking around and their class_object fields couldn't be initialized because the classes don't exist.
//  cut-and-paste bug: forgot to update class descriptor in java.util.zip.ZipFile/ZipEntry
//  forgot a return statement after finding the right field in putInstanceFieldValue
//  slight problem: initializing a ZipFile causes ZipEntry to be created reflectively, but there is no no-arg constructor.  added explicit check for bootstrapping in ZipFile.
//  forgot to update constructors in Thread mirror class
//  forgot to add _class field to java.lang.reflect.Array
//  was creating a mirror class for an anonymous class in ZipFile.  changed to use a different class name.
//  FileSystem.getFileSystem cannot use java.io.FileSystem in its descriptor because it is not a public class, but we still need it to override correctly.
//  references to a merged method in other class's constant pools were not referring to the new, merged copy.  changed to mutate the old copy.
//  search/replace bug:  Thread.registerNatives got renamed to registerReflections
//  forgot to reset access_flags (specifically, native flag) when merging methods in classes
//  forgot to call _umask, so all files were being opened read-only
//  miscopied constants from C header file (octal, not hex!) leading to files being opened read-only
//  in Trimmer, can't just set AddAllClassMembers flag to false when we want to not automatically add all class methods, because we still want to add the fields.
//  in Trimmer, adding a static field by simply being in the same class did not add its value
//  don't call addStaticFieldValue on a primitive type field!
//  x86ReferenceCompiler always attempts to get the bytecodes of a method on creation, leading to crashes if the method doesn't have any bytecode
//  forgot to move initCallPatches call after the cls_initialize calls in Bootstrapper
//  jq_Method.compile_stub wasn't guaranteeing that compile() was compiled
//  changing to use Reflection class messed up reflection target prediction hack in Trimmer
//  Linker.invoke* were not being marked as necessary.
//  needsDynamicLink of instance fields/methods was not taking into account boot image types, leading all invokespecials to be dynamically linked
//  compile() of a native/abstract method was calling cls_initialize on x86ReferenceLinker (and therefore java.lang.Object) leading to extra call patches and corruption of code
//  compiling NEWARRAY caused cls_initialize to be called on the array type, which caused java.lang.Object methods to be compiled
//  forgot to add Reflection.obj_trav to the list of null static fields
//  setting jq.Bootstrapping should occur before any class initialization takes place (i.e. before setting trace flags)
//  Reflection._invokestatic_noargs was referring to nonexisting method
//  ZipEntry._constructor was referring to nonexisting method
//  CodeAllocator._compiled_methods had the wrong type signature
//  forgot that allocateCodeBlock code_reloc and data_reloc could be null, so the addAll call was crashing
//  BootstrapCodeAllocator corrected by startIndex and then called get1, which also corrected by startIndex
//  malformed loop: put return in loop rather than after it.
//  mistyped an offset when outputting the coff file
//  jq_Member.isFinal was checking the ACC_STATIC flag rather than the ACC_FINAL flag
//  inverted the section numbers in relocations (0 <-> 1)
//  forgot to relocate references to addresses of static fields in code
//  in backpatching, did target-code+4 instead of target-code-4, leading backpatchs to be off by 8
//  forgot to add relocs for vtable pointers in objects
//  wasn't adding relocs for external references
//  symbol table numbers were off by 2 because of inserted entry_0 and trap_handler_8 syments
//  name match against entry_0 and trap_handler_8 forgot numbers
//  forgot to skip adding relocs for null static fields
//  forgot to add jq_CompiledCode.entrypoint to code fields
//  was adding code relocations in the data segment to a list, but wasn't doing anything with that list
//  forgot some classes referenced by System.initializeSystemClass in the class list
//  pushing null constant caused relocation to be created for it
//  code (.text) section is by default write protected, so backpatching crashed
//  forgot to add some classes to the class list
//  forgot to initialize CodeAllocator.DEFAULT
//  forgot to relocate CodeAllocator.lowAddress and CodeAllocator.highAddress, so stack walking was broken.
//  CodeAllocator.lowAddress and CodeAllocator.highAddress were being initialized BEFORE anything was compiled!
//  by putting static field relocs in initStaticField, when initStaticField was called more than once for a field, relocs were being also added more than once
//  array classes not in list were not being initialized
//  comparison in CompiledCode.compareTo assertion was using > rather than >=
//  RuntimeCodeAllocator.endian2 was incorrect
//  Reflection.invoke were asserting for isClsInitialized, but static methods could be called during clinit
//  jq_InstanceMethod.needsDynamicLink was incorrect, condition was reversed
//  printing some floats crashed because f2i was not correct, because double constants were stored in the wrong dword order
//  in BootstrapCodeAllocator, was updating current_bundle ptr on ensureCapacity
//  forgot to support path seperator in command line class path
//  forgot to add padding to the last object in the boot image
//  in bootstrapper, adding reloc for static field failed because it was in nullStaticFields
//  in Reflection.putfield_L, wrong endianness
//  forgot to support path seperator in bootstrap command line class path
//  typo in ZipFile, used _class.newInstance() when I meant ZipEntry._class.newInstance()
//  forgot to trigger class loading before type checking when using Class.isAssignableFrom, etc.
//  tricky! in Utf8, table[getID()] failed because getID() could rewrite table, but the code was using the old table!!
//  calling keySet() on a TreeMap (compiled_methods) causes its fields to change, messing up bootstrapping.
//  system also creates an instance of ByteToChar via reflection.  added to trimmer.
//  exception delivery crashed when a non-Java stack frame was on the stack, because the cc had no method or TryCatch
//  forgot to add code/data relocs to generated cc for compile_stub
//  flipped assertion in ThreadQueue.enqueue
//  reversed the arguments in asm.emit2_Reg_Mem
//  disable/enableThreadSwitch in jq_Thread was a static function, causing it to always operate on the current thread!
//  forgot to push result in _isEQ, causing the stack to screw up (and isEQ to always return true)
//  was subtracting 1 instead of LOCK_COUNT_INC in monitorexit
//  in NativeThread, reallocated CodeAllocator rather than calling init() on it
//  status flags used 0xf, but Monitors were aligned at an 8 byte alignment
//  forgot to resume the timer interrupt thread after creating it!
//  run method of timer interrupt thread was not compiled and the thread block was not set yet, so it couldn't be compiled.
//  forgot to initialize code/heap allocator for interrupter native thread.
//  in threadSwitch, the register state pointed to the start of the threadSwitch function, so when we resumed from it, it just reentered the threadSwitch
//  compare and swap when installing inflated lock was incorrect.
//  in static synch methods, forgot to use Reflection.getJDKType rather than jq_Type.getJavaLangClassObject (which returns null during bootstrapping)
//  typo: _putstatic4 was actually pointing to _getstatic4
//  lock overflow was incorrect, was waiting for lock to be released.
//  when using LOCK_COUNT_MASK when lock entry count overflowed, forgot to right shift it.
//  forgot to set jq_RegisterState.ContextFlags before calling get_thread_context in ctrl_break_handler
//  getClassInitializer was using getStaticMethod instead of getDeclaredStaticMethod, leading to the superclass's <clinit> being invoked
//  using reflection to get a field object returned a new one on every call, causing the bootstrapping phase to screw up
//  forgot a k = k.getSuperclass() in a loop in getStaticFields, leading to an infinite loop
//  allocating arrays that were larger than the threshold didn't work.
//  in Sun's impl, readBytes/writeBytes doesn't throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException when offset == b.length and length == 0 (a bug on their part)
//  forgot to call load() in ClassLoader.findLoadedClass
//  off-by-one errors (too small) in stack walking in various situations. forgot to count the dummy frame from the native stub.
//  isInSamePackage predicate in String.equals was reversed
//  instance field lookup was using instance_fields array when it should have done a recursive lookup on declared_instance_fields
//  overlapping array case in arraycopy was backwards
//  forgot to check array bounds before copying in arraycopy.  the array would get written to even if the bounds were bad.
//  when doing setLocation for BytecodeVisitor, need to change i_end as well as i_start, because get___() routines use i_end
//  off-by-one error in BitStringIterator.hasNext
//  put a "this" instead of a "that" in copy constructor for TypeAnalysis.AnalysisState
//  forgot to set done=true in SingletonIterator, leading to infinite iteration

//  in CFG builder, forgot to add ATHROW as branch connecting to exit
//  forgot to initialize stack depth in TypeAnalysis visitor
//  forgot to handle RET in basic block builder
//  in TypeAnalysis union, mixed up "this" and "that"
//  in interprocedural matching in TypeAnalysis, was calling "copy_deep" for outside nodes, leading to callee outside edges being matched against inside edges added from callee
//  in TypeAnalysis when copying using old_to_new map, we were recursive calling before adding to the map, leading to infinite recursion on cycles
//  with cycle detection in TypeAnalysis union, OutsideProgramLocation.union_deep pushed on the stack and then called supertype ProgramLocation.union_deep, which thought there was a cycle
//  forgot that astore can store jsr ret addr, leading to nullptr in TypeAnalysis
//  visitBytecode call relies on i_end being i_start-1.  array bounds exception
//  reversed the order of arrays in arraycopy, so the old array was getting cleared
//  typo when changing StaticField.sf_initialize, added "address" instead of "offset"
