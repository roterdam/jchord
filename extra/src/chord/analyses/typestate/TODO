remember:
* use static very sparingly (typically only for read-only strings and so on)
* use private and final as often as possible
* use @Override whenever possible
* put as many asserts as possible

0. remove as many static things as possible

1. remove error state; if you ever arrive at a recognized function f in state S such that f neither asserts !S nor does f have a transition S -> ..., then assume state S persists

2. create a bunch of standard specs from TOSEM paper and WALA source repo (Iterator, Socket, etc.)

3. define chord.ts.maxdepth = 3

4. create a program domain say AccPaths of the type Dom<AccessPath>

5. consume a program relation TypeStateParamRel of signature (P x H x AccPaths)

6. to test 4 and 5: set AccPaths = (V U F), and TypeStateParamRel to full (P x H x AccPaths)
