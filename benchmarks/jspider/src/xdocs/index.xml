 <section name="A Quick Overview">

   <p>
     We'll shortly introduce you to JSpider in this section.  You can find more detailed information
     about all topics on this site.
   </p>
   <subsection name="A Web Spider Engine">
     <p>

       JSpider is a Web spider engine.  It is a robot that will generate web traffic, just like you would do
       when you are browsing the internet.

       You can control and configure the robot's behaviour to adapt it to your needs.
       On it's way through sites, it will gather all kinds of information you might be interested in.

       You can use a web spider for different purposes: searching dead links (404 errors) on your website,
       testing your site's performance under heavy load, copying an entire site to your harddisk, etc ...

     </p>
   </subsection>
   <subsection name="Flexible and Extensible">
     <p>
        JSpider is designed with flexibility and extensibility in mind.  A system of plugin modules allows you
        to add your own custom logic to the core engine, so you can use JSpider for any purpose you can think of.
     </p>
   </subsection>
   <subsection name="100% Pure Java">
     <p>
       As JSpider is implemented in 100% pure Java, it is truly platform independent, allowing the same binary download
       to run on Linux, Solaris, Windows, and other Java-enabled Operating Systems.
     </p>
   </subsection>
   <subsection name="Open Source">
     <p>
       Best of all, JSpider is open source.
       You get the source code for the whole engine, so you can adapt it to your needs, learn from it, make remarks on
       it or improve it so others can benifit from your work.
