<section name="Installing JSpider">
  <p>
  This explanation assumes a Unix-like system to be used.  Windows equivalents
  should be obvious.
  </p>

  <subsection name="STEP 1: Download the binary">
  <p>
  You'll need to make sure you have downloaded the JSpider binary from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=65617">our download page</a>, 
  we'll be using this file throughout the rest of this explanation.
  Make sure you have downloaded the latest version of JSPIDER-MAIN, to be sure the latest stable build
  and the latest bugfixes and features are present.
  </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="STEP 2: Extracting the binaries">
  <p>
  There are different formats in which we distribute our binaries: .zip, .tar, and .tar.gz
  In this explanation, we'll assume you downloaded the .zip version.
  </p>
  <p>
  In our example, the install directory will be '/opt'.
  </p>   
  <p>
  Copy the downloaded file to '/opt' (or any other directory you want to use as an install directory).
  </p>
  <source>
  jar -xvf jspider-0-1-1-dev.zip
  (use the filename of the file you downloaded)
  cd jspider-0-1-1-dev
  (use the filename of the file you downloaded without the .jar extension)</source>
  <p>
  Now we're going to make the startup script executable:
  </p>
  <source>
  cd bin
  chmod a+x jspider.sh</source>
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="STEP 3: Testing your JSpider installation">
  <p>
  Now you're ready to test your JSpider installation.  cd into the {jpspider}/bin directory and start JSpider 
  (this example assumes that you have a webserver listening on localhost, port 80):
  </p>
  <source>  ./jspider.sh http://localhost</source>
  <p>
  A lot of output should go on your screen now, as JSpider traverses the site you gave it.
  Congratulations, you've successfully installed JSpider !
  </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="IMPORTANT REMARK: Proxy/Firewall issues">
  <p>
  When you need a proxy/firewall to connect to a certain host, your have to configure that in the JSpider
  configuration files.
  </p>
  <p>
  an explanation of how to do this can be found <a href="../config/proxy.html">here</a> ...
