<section name="Installing JSpider">
  <p>
  There are 2 ways to install JSpider on your system: downloading a binary (which is
  the most preferrable way, as it is the easiest), and building directly from our CVS
  repositories (which gives you access to the very latest additions, not yet included
  in any release).
  </p>

  <subsection name="IMPORTANT NOTE for Java 1.3 - XML Parser">
      <p>
      JSpider needs an XML parser in order to read some of it's configuration files.
      </p>
      <p>
      Starting from Java 1.4 (J2SE 1.4), the needed XML API's and an implementation
      of these are part of the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
      For Java 1.3, however, you'll have to add these yourself.  The best thing you
      can do is to download the open source XML parser Xerces from Apache.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can find this XML parser for download <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/">here</a>.
      You'll have to put the "xml-apis.jar" and "xercesImpl.jar" on your classpath before
      starting JSpider.
      </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Installation instructions">
    <p>
      For both ways of installing JSpider, we offer installation instructions:
    </p>
    <p>
    <table>
      <th>Type</th><th>Description</th>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="./binaries.html">Binary downloads</a></td>
        <td>
         Explanation on how to install JSpider using our binary downloads.
         For most people, this is the most preferrable way.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="./cvs.html">From CVS</a></td>
        <td>
        Explanation on how to build and install JSpider directly from CVS.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>
    When you're going to build JSpider from CVS, or you're going to make changes to the
    sources, it's maybe a good idea to have a look at out ant build script targets <a href="ant.html">here</a>...
    </p>
    <p>
    When you install a new version of jspider directly from CVS, it's maybe a good idea
    to run our JUnit test suite against it to make sure nothing's broken.  More information
    on doing this can be found <a href="testing.html">here</a>.
