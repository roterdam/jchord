<section name="JSPIDER_HOME environment variable">
  <p>
      In the section about the usage of JSpider, you’ve learned that
      you can start it by launching the jspider.bat or jspider.sh startup
      script.  Without any extra configuration, this script assumes that
      your current working directory is {JSPIDER_INSTALL_DIR}/bin.
  </p>
  <p>
      This can be problematic if you want to launch JSpider from another
      location.
  </p>
  <p>
      When JSpider is started, it will look for an environment variable
      called JSPIDER_HOME.  If this is present, that folder is taken as
      reference for the JSpider installation.
  </p>
  <p>
      If this environment variable is not found, the value ‘..’ is assumed,
      changing the current directory from the /bin folder to the
      {JSPIDER_INSTALLATION_DIR} if started from /bin.
  </p>
  <subsection name="setting JSPIDER_HOME">
  <p>
      Setting JSPIDER_HOME is very easy:

      On unix:
  <source>
      export JSPIDER_HOME=/opt/jspider</source>
  </p>
  <p>
      On windows:
  <source>
      set JSPIDER_HOME=c:\jspider</source>
      make sure you use the path to which you installed JSpider.
