<section name="Per-site configuration files">
  <p>
  Per-site configuration files can be found in your /conf/{yourconfig} folder.
  These configuration files are referenced from the sites.properties file, for which
  you can find the documentation <a href="./sites.html">here</a>.
  </p>
  <subsection name="Default configuration file">
  <p>
  You'll find a 'default.properties' files in your distribution, a file that's configured
  to become the default configuration for every site that isn't assigned a special
  configuration in 'sites.properties'.
  Most of the time, you'll want to let this file as it is, but override the settings in a
  per-site specific file of the sites you'll want JSpider to visit.
  </p>
  <p>
  The default configuration file makes sure that each unknown site is handled properly,
  so edit this file only when you really know what you're doing.
  </p>
  <p>
  In your distribution, you'll also find a 'j-spider.sourceforge.net' file, which is the
  configuration you'll need to test JSpider on it's own project site.  These files can be
  used as a reference when you're creating your own:

  # Default Site Configuration File
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  #
  # This is the default per-site configuration file. Each site for which no
  # configuration file is specified will default to this configuration.
  # By adding specific configuration files under this folder, you can configure
  # the behaviour of JSpider on a per-site basis.
  #
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Proxy Configuration
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Determines whether this site is to be accessed via the proxy server defined
  # in jspider.properties.
  #
  # PROPERTIES :
  #
  #  site.proxy.use
  #    whether the proxy settings defined in jspider.properties are applicable
  #    to this site.
  #    if 'true', the settings in jspider.properties are used.  if 'false', this
  #    site is treated as a local site, and accessed without going through the
  #    proxy server.
  #    if no proxy is configured in jspider.properties (jspider.proxy.use in that
  #    file is set to false), then this setting doesn't matter.
  #
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  site.proxy.use=true



  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Throttling Configuration
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Throttling allows you to keep the number of requests over a given time period
  # towards a specific server under control.
  # Without throttling, JSpider running on a fast machine with a speedy internet
  # connection would choke the target system with requests.  By configuring
  # throttling, you can tell JSpider how it should spread its requests to one
  # server.  By tweaking these settings, you can generate more or less traffic
  # on a server (to do scalability/load testing), or influence the usage pattern
  # of the site.
  # Please note that throttling influences only the maximum amount of requests to
  # be done towards a server in a given timeframe.  If your JSpider system is
  # heavily loaded, it is possible that these numbers aren't reached and that
  # throttling doesn't have to hold the parser threads for a while.
  # by default, a throttle implementation that forces a minimum amount of milli-
  # seconds between two subsequent requests to the same host is provided.
  #
  # PROPERTIES :
  #
  #  site.throttle.provider
  #   the class that implements the Provider interface via which the Throttle
  #   implementation is created.  This way, you can easily plug in your own
  #   throttle implementation.
  #   A few default implementations are provided, configuration of these
  #   is explained below:
  #
  # DISTRIBUTED LOAD THROTTLE (default)
  # -----------------------------------
  #
  # When using the distributed load throttle (the default throttle), a minimum
  # number of milliseconds between two subsequent requests to the same server
  # are enforced.
  #
  # PROPERTIES :
  #
  #  site.throttle.interval
  #    minimum number of milliseconds between two requests to the same server.
  #    when a request is to be made faster then allowed, the request is postponed
  #    until the next allowed timeframe.
  #
  # SIMULTANEOUS USERS THROTTLE
  # ---------------------------
  #
  # By enabling this throttle strategy, you can simulate load on a system by
  # different simultaneous users.
  # Each spider thread (configured in jspider.properties) will act as a simulated
  # user, and will be throttled on its own.  The 'thinking time' for each user
  # can be configured to simulate real system loads.
  # This throttle implementation can cause a much more diversed request pattern.
  # (Several requests at the same time, then no requests for a while, etc ...
  #
  # PROPERTIES :
  #
  #  site.throttle.thinktime.min
  #    minimum number of milliseconds between two requests from the same
  #    simulated user (spider thread).
  #
  #  site.throttle.thinktime.max
  #    maximum number of milliseconds between two requests from the same
  #    simulated user (spider thread).
  #
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # --- COMMENT OUT TO USE OTHER THROTTLE IMPLEMENTATION ------------------------
  site.throttle.provider=net.javacoding.jspider.core.throttle.impl.DistributedLoadThrottleProvider
  site.throttle.config.interval=1000

  #site.throttle.config.thinktime.max=5000



  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Cookie Configuration
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Configures the cookie usage for the sites that are given this configuration
  #
  # PROPERTIES :
  #
  #  site.cookies.use
  #    whether cookies should be accepted and sent back to the site (true/false)
  #
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  site.cookies.use=true



  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Robots.txt configuration
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Configures the handling of the robots.txt file on this site
  #
  # PROPERTIES :
  #
  #  site.robotstxt.fetch
  #    whether the spider should fetch the robots.txt file
  #
  #  site.robotstxt.obey
  #    whether the spider should obey the robots.txt file
  #
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  site.robotstxt.fetch=true
  site.robotstxt.obey=true



  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Rules Configuration
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Tells the system what rules to apply upon encountered URLs from this site.
  #
  # PROPERTIES:
  #
  #  site.rules.spider.count
  #    The number of rules that will be applied on all URLs before being taken
  #    into account for spidering (fetching)
  #
  #  site.rules.spider.[number]
  #    the name of the class that provides the rule implementation by which the
  #    urls should be handled
  #
  #  site.rules.parser.count
  #    The number of rules that will be applied on all URLs before being taken
  #    into account for parsing
  #
  #  site.rules.parser.[number]
  #    the name of the class that provides the rule implementation by which the
  #    urls should be handled
  #
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  site.rules.spider.count=2
  site.rules.spider.1.class=net.javacoding.jspider.mod.rule.InternallyReferencedOnlyRule
