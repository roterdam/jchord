[ SOMEDAY ] PLANNED :
---------------------

  custom classloading (?)
    instead of putting everything on the classpath in startup scripts
      + easy way to add plugins, etc...
    common/lib/*.jar (change /lib to /common/lib)
    common/classes
    common/
  refactor context/agent stuff
  implement DAO cache for DB storage
  refactor EventDispatcherImpl, add FilteringEventDispatcherImpl
  configure url fixing
      - convert backslashes? (Y/N)
      - remove dot folders? (Y/N)
      - strip query? (Y/N)
      - remove trailing slashes? (Y/N)
  diskwriter improvements
      option to map certain extensions to another
        plugin.config.mapping.enabled = true/false
        plugin.config.mapping.from.extension=jsp php pl asp
        plugin.config.mapping.to.extension=html
        plugin.config.mapping.mime=text/html
        change also in links of all resources !
  - improve robots.txt handling:
      max size (DOS attack on spider) + tests ( site.robotstxt.maxsize=... )
      implement allow lines (order!!!) + add tests
      implement double useragents (same rules) in robots.txt (+add test)
      implement 401 and 403 on robots.txt to skip site
      http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots-rfc.txt

  jspider optional addons pack (cvs jspider-optional)
    swing gui plugin (progression, etc...)
  new project site (cvs jspider-site)
  mention/use RFC 2616 (http statuses - do something with these?)

  xml configuration files
  rules that can change an url (remove params, ...)
  Configuration for handling of non-HTTP protocols (ftp,news,https,gopher,...)
  Add HTML WelformedNess Check (While parsing?  Afterwards?)
  improve cookiesupport (path, time to live, ...)
  support multiple fetches of same resource (comparing timing, etc...)
  support decoupled eventDispatcher (per-plugin basis, async, dispatcher thread)
  optimize storage - have notion of added or changed entities and only save those
  support setting case-sensitivity option when comparing URLs
  jdk1.4 logging filepath could be problematic
    if not started from /bin (../x used)
    how to solve ?
