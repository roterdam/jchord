To run this test case:

1. Run the following command in the current directory:

   ant

   This will compile the Java source code of the test case.

2. Run the following command in Chord's root directory:

   ant -Dchord.work.dir=examples/deadlock_test run-deadlock

   This will eventually produce file deadlocks.html in
   directory examples/deadlock_test/chord_output/.
