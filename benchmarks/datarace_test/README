To run this test case:

1. Run the following command in the current directory:

   ant

   This will compile the Java source code of the test case.

2. Run the following command in Chord's root directory:

   ant -Dchord.work.dir=examples/datarace_test run-datarace

   This will eventually produce file dataces_by_fld.html and
   dataraces_by_obj.html in directory
   examples/datarace_test/chord_output/.
