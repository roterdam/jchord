/**
 * Combines multiple files into a single compound file.
 * The file format:<br>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>VInt fileCount</li>
 *     <li>{Directory}
 *         fileCount entries with the following structure:</li>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>long dataOffset</li>
 *             <li>UTFString extension</li>
 *         </ul>
 *     <li>{File Data}
 *         fileCount entries with the raw data of the corresponding file</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The fileCount integer indicates how many files are contained in this compound
 * file. The {directory} that follows has that many entries. Each directory entry
 * contains an encoding identifier, an long pointer to the start of this file's
 * data section, and a UTF String with that file's extension.
