\section{Troubleshooting}
\label{sec:troubleshooting}

This section describes known common problems with running \Chord\ and how to fix or work around them.
We assume that the following command was run in \Chord's {\tt main/} directory:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
prompt> ant -Dchord.work.dir=<...> <sys-props> run
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

where {\tt <sys-props>} denotes a whitespace-separated list of zero of more property definitions
of the form {\tt -D<key>=<value>} (see Section \ref{sec:chord-sysprops} for an exhaustive listing of all
properties recognized by \Chord).

Abnormal termination of the above command typically produces output of the form:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
Buildfile: build.xml

props-file:

pathconvert:

run:
     [java] java version "1.6.0"
     [java] ... // JVM version details omitted
     [java] 
     [java] Redirecting stdout to file: <...>/chord_output/log.txt
     [java] Redirecting stderr to file: <...>/chord_output/log.txt
     [java] Java Result: 1

BUILD FAILED
<...>/main/build.xml:325: Chord terminated abnormally; see above file(s) for details.
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

The first step is to inspect the file(s) reported above to which stdout and stderr were redirected.
We next list common errors and how to fix or work around them.
