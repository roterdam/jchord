\chapter{Program Domain}
\label{chap:domain}

A {\it program domain} represents an indexed set of values of a fixed
kind, typically from the program being analyzed, such as the set of all methods
in the program, the set of all fields in the program, etc.  Indices are
assigned starting from 0 and in the order in which values are added to the set.
A program domain primarily serves as an input to Datalog analyses.

There are multiple ways to create a program domain.

1. Using template ProgramDom

2. Produced by another Analysis

3. Manual
